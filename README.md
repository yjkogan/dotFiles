## TODOs (this'll probably require that I try from scratch)
- Make sure the emacs keybindings still work. Copy the file and create a script for it
- Script to install applications and set desired configuration
  - Emacs
  - VSCode
  - Firefox (?)
  - Chrome (?)
  - iTerm2
- Use Keyboard Maestro for rebinding instead?

[Link to keybindings for meta keys on OSX](http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/~jrus/site/KeyBindings/Emacs%20Opt%20Bindings.dict)

Put it in ~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict
